We are solving the problem by developing 'TRACKMART,' a virtual map tool built with JavaScript, TypeScript, and Mappedin SDK for real-time location tracking and data analytics. TRACKMART guides customers to their desired products while leveraging analytics to provide insights on frequently visited sections. This enables employees to optimize product placement and marketing strategies using a React-based employee portal. The portal also tracks inventory levels and includes a layout design tool powered by CSS and Mappedin's layout API for real-time updates to the product arrangement on the map
